            <p>This movie shouldn't have happened, I only enjoy it because of Quigon-Jinn and Darth Maul. 
              Do yourself a favor and just skip over to their epic fight scene!! Ok, actually watch the Pod-Race too
              just because it's cool and you'll get Sebulba references in the future. *sigh* yes, that is definitely
              a litte kid flirting with Natalie Portman. Be "an angel" and overlook it. (you'll laugh at this after
              you watch the movie)</p>

            <p>Yes, I know. Why make Anakin so young in the first movie when the time jump does not justify
              how old he is now?? Nonetheless, this is Anakin in my eyes! Critics say his acting wasn't all that
              great, but I think he was just working with the cards he was dealt. The clones only attack once and 
              Anakin and Padme fall in love. That's pretty much it. You can skip this one if you want.

            <info>Episodes:</info> 121 Episodes <br>
            <p>This is the pre-quels done RIGHT!! 10/10 best show ever. This series takes place between the events of Ep. 2 and 3. This is where the Clones actually attack.
              Clone Wars is an anthology series, therefore the events in the episodes did not come out in chronologial order. Visit this 
              <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-Ep.order" alt="Clone Wars Order">website</a> to know which episodes to watch.

            <p>In my opinion, you can skip the first two movies and just start your STAR WARS journey with this movie. 
              Once you get passed the outdated CGI it is seriously the only watchable prequel. The ending is so good! 
              This movie is easily one of my top 5 STAR WARS movies.</p>

            <p> This movie didn't need to happen either. It is the lowest grossing STAR WARS Film that has come out under
              the Disney umbrella. It's not a bad movie, but you don't miss out on anything if you don't watch it. The only 
              part that's nice to watch is when Han meets Chewy. Oh! and Donald Glover is such a perfect casting as Lando. 
              But no one wanted a Han Solo "solo" movie without Harrison Ford. So feel free to skip this one too!

            <p>This series fills the gap between the events of Ep. III and Ep. IV. It is sort of the Clone Wars
              for the younger generation, although they should be watching Clone Wars as well! It's received praise and can 
              help make sense of some things. Give it a watch!

            <p>The best movie to have come out from the Disney umbrella! This movie is beautifully shot and you'll
              be chanting "I'm one with the force, the force is with me" for a while after watching it. The movie 
              does so much justice to STAR WARS. The ending is AMAZING. If you haven't watched Ep. 4, watch it RIGHT
              AFTER this movie. It'll all make sense!!

            <p>The movie that started it all! This is where people get confused. You could start the movies
              in the way they were released but I think watching the story unfold as it was meant to be is 
              way more enjoyable. Totally up to you! But yes, this movie happens right after the events in
              Revenge of the Sith. You get introduced to the infamous cast and it's such a great movie.

            <p>Otherwise known as the BEST STAR WARS film ever!! This is a lot of people's favorite movie. 
              It broke the box office when it came out, surprassing the sales of A New Hope. This is where
              Darth Vader's famous "Luke, I am your father" line makes it's appearance. BUT he actually says
              "NO, I am your father." Everyone says Luke, which to me sounds better but listen closely when
              watching!! You'll also be responding "I know" the next time someone tells you that they love you
              after watching this film. This is also the film where they introduce Yoda! 10/10 recommend this movie!

          <p>This movie is a classic, it is not as well received as the first two but it is still very much
            loved. Princess Leia's famous Slave bikini is introduced, Boba Fett is let go in the dumbest
            way possible and Chewbacca does not receive a metal :( (pay attention at the end). Watch this one too!!

            <p>THE BEST STAR WARS show next to Clone Wars!! This show is a work of art. Each Ep. is like a movie,
              the directors they got for this are so good! Dave Filoni is back, he worked on Clone Wars so of course 
              he'd make this a huge hit! Alongside Jon Faveru who is famous for starting up the Marvel Cinematic Universe
              with Iron Man, he also plays Happy in those movies. He knows STAR WARS and does it justice. This is the best
              thing that Disney has made. We can't forget about the Child aka Baby Yoda either!! He has stolen all of our hearts.
              You don't need to know much about STAR WARS to watch this so WATCH IT NOW!</p>

            <p>This was the first movie to have come out from the Disney franchise and it actually had me excited for the
              new movies. A lot of people complain and say it's a rehash of A New Hope but New Hope is my favorite movie so
              i'm a little biased when I say that this movie is great. It's not perfect, but it is definitely the only movie 
              I enjoyed out of the new triology. BB-8 steals the show and I loved Rey in this movie. It's a good time, watch it!

            <p>I had a lot of hope for this movie. I thought a lot of the questions from Ep. 7 would have been answered but nothing
            gets answered. This movie basically throws out whatever was established in the previous film and does whatever it wants to do.
            They tarnished Luke's character and gave big roles to disposable characters when that could have been given to the main cast.
            Rose's character needs to go or be improved. I felt for her sister more than I did for her and she is only in the movie for a few minutes.
            Now don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful. It is shot so nicely but it is not a good STAR WARS film. You can watch this if you 
            want, but I don't recommend it.

            <info>Budget:</info> $275,000,000<br>
            <p>This film was supposed to make up for the mess The Last Jedi left behind but all it did was create an even bigger mess. I had high
              hopes because JJ Abrahms returned to direct and I enjoyed the Force Awakens. But unfortunately, this movie tries to tie in a bunch of 
              different stories into one and basically tries to yet again erase the previous movie. It brings back an old character that we all thought 
              was dead and the explanation they give for Rey's character is just a huge disappointment. They built up her character for nothing. You can 
              skip this, along with the entire new trilogy because it really doesn't add anything else to the story. To me, the Skywalker saga ended in Ep. 6.

    In conclusion, Star Wars has had a lot of mixed reviews but it is loved by so many people nonetheless.
    There is something for everyone! What I might like you might hate and what I might hate you might like! That's the
    beauty of Star Wars. I hope this helped you make sense of all the different movies and shows.
    Now, GO AND WATCH IT! You won't regret it.
